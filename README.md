# mpc
mechanical properties of crystals and polycrystalline aggregates

[api docs](https://threecubed.github.io/mpc/)

mpc is a header-only template library written in c++ for working with the
mechanical properties of crystals and polycrystalline aggregates...

Overview:
* core data structures: stress, strain, stiffness, and compliance tensors
* symmetry
* Hooke's Law
* stiffness <-> compliance relationships
* tensor transformations
* tensor invariants and Voigt/Ruess bounds
* simple rock physics transforms
* velocities in anisotropic media

TO BE COMPLETED...
