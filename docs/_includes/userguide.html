                      mpc is c++ header-only template library designed for the
                      explicit calculation of the mechanical properties of a
                      crystal or polycrystalline aggregate in a three-dimensional
                      Cartesian space.  The library's primary purpose is to compute
                      the static effective stiffness and compliance tensors of
                      heterogeneous or composite materials and the corresponding
                      velocities using the Green-Christoffel equation.

                      The user should be familiar the basics of continuum
                      mechanics, particularly solid mechanics including, at a
                      minimum, tensor algebra.  This user guide will walk you
                      through creating the core data structures that make mpc.
                      These core data structures are based on the concept of a
                      tensor which is at the core of mechanics and thus form
                      the core data structures for mpc.

                      We assume that the material obeys Hooke's law; that is,
                      there exists a linear relationship between the stress
                      applied to the material and the corresponding strain.
                      Hooke's law is written is concise suffix notation as
                      \[
                        \sigma_{ij} = c_{ijkl} \epsilon_{kl}
                      \]
                      or
                      \[
                        \epsilon_{kl} = s_{klij} \sigma_{ij}
                      \]
                      where \(\sigma_{ij}\) is the stress tensor, \(\epsilon_{kl}\)
                      is the strain tensor, \(c_{ijkl}\) is the stiffness
                      tensor, and \(s_{klmn}\) is the compliance tensor...

                    <h4>terminology and mpc conventions</h4>
                    <p>
                      While stress and strain can be measured in two
                      dimensions and possibly any curvilinear coordinate system,
                      this higher level of abstraction was considered beyond
                      the scope of the project.  Therefore, all tensors are
                      considered to be Cartesian tensors in a three-dimensional
                      space.

                      Like most computational libraries, mpc has a few core
                      data structures, most notably, the
                      <font face="Courier New">StiffnessTensor</font> class and
                      <font face="Courier New">ComplianceTensor</font> class
                      which are used ubiquitously throughout the library to
                      describe the mathematical objects, the stiffness tensor
                      and compliance tensor, respectively.  Before we can use
                      these classes, we must discuss the terminology of
                      tensors used in the library and the abstract data types
                      that form the foundation of the library generated from
                      these concepts.

                      As previously mentioned, we will do our investigation in
                      three-dimensional space calculating the stiffness and
                      compliance of a representative volume; therefore, the
                      indices will take the range i,j,... = 1,2,3.  This is
                      known as the <em>range convention</em>.  The second
                      convention to note, which we have already used, is the
                      summation convention for which we define the
                      <em>rank</em> of a tensor as the number of "free"
                      indices - those indices which do not repeat.  For
                      example, the stiffness and compliance tensors are of rank
                      four corresponding to the free indices <em>i</em>,
                      <em>j</em>, <em>k</em>,and <em>l</em>.  The stress and
                      strain tensors are of rank two corresponding to the
                      free indices <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>, or <em>k</em> and
                      <em>l</em>.  A vector is of rank one and written in
                      suffix notation as \(v_i\) where <em>i</em> takes the
                      range 1,2,3 in three dimensional space. Finally, a scalar
                      value is a tensor of rank zero and written without a
                      free index as \(\alpha\).  Note that a tensor with a
                      "dummy" index is also a scalar value, e.g.
                      \(\alpha_{ii}\).  These <em>invariants</em> are very
                      important in tensor analysis and will be discussed later
                      in the user guide.

                    <p>
                      Tensors in mpc are represented as multi-dimensional
                      arrays in which each dimension corresponds to an index
                      and the values in that dimension correspond to the range
                      convention of the tensor.  mpc defines this index with a
                      template class TensorRankNComponentIndex.
