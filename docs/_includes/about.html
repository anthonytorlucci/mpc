                <h2>about mpc</h2>
                <p>
                  mpc is c++ header-only template library designed for the
                  explicit calculation of the mechanical properties of a
                  crystal or polycrystalline aggregate in a three-dimensional
                  Cartesian space.  The library's primary purpose is to compute
                  the static effective stiffness and compliance tensors of
                  heterogeneous or composite materials and the corresponding
                  velocities using the Green-Christoffel equation.

                  The user guide page illustrates the core data structures and
                  a few examples of how to use the library for computational
                  experiments with elastic tensor data of crystals.
